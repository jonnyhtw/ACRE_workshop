# ACRE WORKSHOP "Climate indices and synoptic types in Python" 

## ressources 

For this session, I strongly recommend installing the [Anaconda Python Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/), which is available for Windows, Mac and Linux and ships all the main Python scientific libraries. 

You can refer to [https://github.com/nicolasfauchereau/Auckland_Python_Workshop#the-anaconda-python-distribution](https://github.com/nicolasfauchereau/Auckland_Python_Workshop#the-anaconda-python-distribution) for more details about installing Anaconda and some additional libraries (e.g. [xarray](http://xarray.pydata.org/)) on your machine. 

For Windows user, a nice ressource (highly recommended reading also for those on Macs) is [https://www.dataquest.io/blog/pydata-windows/](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/pydata-windows/). 

## Material 

The material will consist in [Jupyter notebooks](http://jupyter.org/), which, in a nutshell, is an interactive development environment running in your browser and allowing to create executable documents mixing code, rich text comments, figures, etc. These can be found in the `notebooks` directory of the present github repo, at [https://github.com/nicolasfauchereau/ACRE_workshop/tree/master/notebooks](https://github.com/nicolasfauchereau/ACRE_workshop/tree/master/notebooks). If you don't want to install anything and / or run the notebooks, you can follow along by just clicking on the notebooks links on github, they will be rendered in HTML by github.: 

+ [https://github.com/nicolasfauchereau/ACRE_workshop/blob/master/notebooks/climate_indices.ipynb](https://github.com/nicolasfauchereau/ACRE_workshop/blob/master/notebooks/climate_indices.ipynb) is devoted to reading and constructing climate indices from climate fields. 
+ [https://github.com/nicolasfauchereau/ACRE_workshop/blob/master/notebooks/weather_regimes.ipynb](https://github.com/nicolasfauchereau/ACRE_workshop/blob/master/notebooks/weather_regimes.ipynb) will show how to derive so called 'weather regimes' or 'synoptic types' from a reanalysis dataset over a regional domain. A good ressource on weather regimes is [Michelangeli et al, 1995](http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/1520-0469%281995%29052%3C1237%3AWRRAQS%3E2.0.CO%3B2)
